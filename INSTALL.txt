This document describes the installation of pylidar-tls-canopy from source. 

The Source Code
---------------

There are no source code bundle releases yet. To install pylidar-tls-canopy from the source code, you need to have cloned the repository.
At the command line:
    git clone https://github.com/armstonj/pylidar-tls-canopy.git

    
Prerequisites
-------------
    
To install pylidar-tls-canopy you will need the packages listed in the environment.yml file

For RiVLib and RDBLib, you will also need a C compiler that is compatible. RiVLib is not available for MacOS.

The use of RIEGL proprietary formats requires the following environment variables to be set before building:
    export RIVLIB_ROOT="/RiVLibRootDirectory"
    export RDBLIB_ROOT="/RDBLibRootDirectory"
    export PYLIDAR_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++11"

RiVLib (version >=2.6.0 required) and RDBLib (version >=2.4.0 required) can be downloaded from the RIEGL members area at http://www.riegl.com/members-area/software-downloads/libraries/. 
If you don't have a RIEGL members area login, you can also find the appropriate RIEGL library downloads for your system [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ORdOxGI23D_uB0f4iVsyvVCldk1zekle?usp=sharing). This link will disappear once this repository is made public or merged with pylidar.

This software also assumes RDBX files have been generated using RiScanPro version >= 2.15.

pylidar-tls-canopy will install without RIEGL libraries being available, but will then only work with LEAF data files.


Installation
------------
To install a new conda environment with all required dependencies:
  cd pylidar-tls-canopy
  conda env create -f environment.yml

Before creating the conda environment, you will need to edit the environment.yml file to modify the paths to the RDBLib and RiVLIB download root directories on your local system. If you are only installing pylidar-tls-canopy for analysis of LEAF data then remove these lines. You also need to be using conda version >= 4.9.

To load the conda environment:
  conda activate pylidar-tls-canopy

To install pylidar-tls-canopy, run the command:
  pip install . -v
The -v provides verbose output, which can be helpful to diagnose problems.
 
If you wish to install in a non-default location, use
  pip install . --prefix=/yourChosenDirectory
