This document describes the installation of pylidar-tls-canopy from source. 

The Source Code
---------------

There are no source code bundle releases yet. To install pylidar-tls-canopy from the source code, you need to have cloned the repository.
At the command line:
    git clone https://github.com/armstonj/pylidar-tls-canopy.git

    
Prerequisites
-------------
    
To install pylidar-tls-canopy you will need the packages listed in the environment.yml file
For RiVLib, you will also need a C compiler that is compatible.

The use of RIEGL proprietary formats requires the following environment variables to be set before building:
    export RIVLIB_ROOT="/RiVLibRootDirectory"
    export PYLIDAR_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++11"

For processing of RIEGL data, you will also need to install the Python API for RDBLib before building. A pip wheel is available in the RIEGL RDBLib download (read the README.TXT file in the ```interface/python``` directory of your RDBLib download).

RiVLib (version >=2.6.0 required) and RDBLib (version >=2.4.0 required) can be downloaded from the RIEGL members area at http://www.riegl.com/members-area/software-downloads/libraries/. 
If you don't have a RIEGL members area login, you can also find the appropriate RIEGL library downloads for your system [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ORdOxGI23D_uB0f4iVsyvVCldk1zekle?usp=sharing). This link will disappear once this repository is made public or merged with pylidar.

This software also assumes RDBX files have been generated using RiScanPro version >= 2.15.

pylidar-tls-canopy will install without RIEGL libraries being available, but will then only work with LEAF data files.


Installation
------------
To install a new conda environment named pylidar-tls-canopy including this software:
  cd pylidar-tls-canopy
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate pylidar-tls-canopy
Before creating the conda environment, you will need to edit the environment.yml file to modify the paths to the RDBLib pip wheel and the RiVLIB download root directory on your local system. If you are only installing pylidar-tls-canopy for analysis of LEAF data then remove these lines. You also need to be using conda version >= 4.9.

To install in your chosen environment, run the command:
  cd pylidar-tls-canopy
  pip install .
  
If you wish to install in a non-default location, use
  pip install . --prefix=/yourChosenDirectory

If installed in a non-default location, you will then need to ensure that the 
right environment variables are set. For simple bash syntax, this would be 
something like:
    export PATH="/yourChosenDirectory/bin:$PATH"
    export PYTHONPATH="/yourChosenDirectory/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"
    
Note that the pythonX.X sub-directory needs to match your version of python.
